NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

You will learn how to build an application with multiple modules with Maven and Open Liberty.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

A Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application consists of modules that work together as one entity. An enterprise archive (EAR) is a wrapper for a Java EE application, which consists of web archive (WAR) and Java archive (JAR) files. To deploy or distribute the Java EE application into new environments, all the modules and resources must first be packaged into an EAR file.

You will learn how to establish a dependency between a web module and a Java library module. You will use Maven to package the WAR file and the JAR file into an EAR file so that you can run and test the application on Open Liberty.

You will build a unit converter application that converts heights from centimeters into feet and inches. The application will request the user to enter a height value in centimeters. Then, the application processes the input by using functions that are found in the JAR file to return the height value in imperial units.


// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

Access partial implementation of the application from the `start` folder. This folder includes a web module in the `war` folder, a Java library in the `jar` folder, and template files in the `ear` folder. However, the Java library and the web module are independent projects, and you will need to complete the following steps to implement the application:

1. Add a dependency relationship between the two modules.

2. Assemble the entire application into an EAR file.

3. Aggregate the entire build.

4. Test the multi-module application.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following
Maven goal to build the application:

[role=command]
----
cd finish
mvn install
----

To deploy your EAR application on an Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:run` goal from the `ear` directory:

[role=command]
----
cd ear
mvn liberty:run
----

Once the server is running, you can find the application at the following URL: http://localhost:9080/converter/[http://localhost:9080/converter/^]

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `finish\ear` directory in another command-line session:

[role=command]
----
mvn liberty:stop
----

// =================================================================================================
// Adding dependencies between WAR and JAR modules
// =================================================================================================

== Adding dependencies between WAR and JAR modules

To use a Java library in your web module, you must add a dependency relationship between the two modules.

As you might have noticed, each module has its own `pom.xml` file. Each module has its own `pom.xml` file because each module is treated as an independent project. You can rebuild, reuse, and reassemble every module on its own.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the war/POM file.#
`war/pom.xml`
----
war/pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/war/pom.xml[]
----
The [hotspot=dependency file=0]`dependency` element is the Java library module that implements the functions that you need for the unit converter.

With this dependency, you can use any functions included in the library in the [hotspot file=1]`HeightsBean.java` file of the web module.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `HeightsBean` class.#
`war/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/web/HeightsBean.java`
----
HeightsBean.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/war/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/web/HeightsBean.java[]
----

The [hotspot=getFeet file=1]`getFeet(cm)` invocation was added to the [hotspot=setHeightFeet file=1]`setHeightFeet` method to convert a measurement into feet.

The [hotspot=getInches file=1]`getInches(cm)` invocation was added to the [hotspot=setHeightInches file=1]`setHeightInches` method to convert a measurement into inches.


// =================================================================================================
// Assembling multiple modules into an EAR file
// =================================================================================================

== Assembling multiple modules into an EAR file

To deploy the entire application on the Open Liberty server, first package the application. Use the EAR project to assemble multiple modules into an EAR file.

Navigate to the `ear` folder and find a template `pom.xml` file.
[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the ear/POM file.#
`ear/pom.xml`
----
ear/pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/ear/pom.xml[]
----

Set the [hotspot=packaging file=0]`basic configuration` for the project and set the [hotspot=packagingType file=0]`packaging` element to `ear`.

The [hotspot=dependency-jar file=0]`Java library module` and the [hotspot=dependency-war file=0]`web module` were added as dependencies. Specify a type of [hotspot=warType file=0]`war` for the web module. If you donâ€™t specify this type for the web module, Maven looks for a JAR file.

The definition and configuration of the [hotspot=maven-ear-plugin file=0]`maven-ear-plugin` plug-in were added to create an EAR file. Define the [hotspot=jarModule file=0]`jarModule` and [hotspot=webModule file=0]`webModule` modules to be packaged into the EAR file.
To customize the context root of the application, set the [hotspot=contextRoot file=0]`contextRoot` element to [hotspot=contextRoot file=0]`/converter` in the [hotspot=webModule file=0]`webModule`. Otherwise, Maven automatically uses the WAR file `artifactId` ID as the context root for the application while generating the `application.xml` file.

To download and start an Open Liberty server, use the [hotspot=liberty-maven-plugin file=0]`liberty-maven-plugin` plug-in for Maven. This configuration is provided, and the executions of the plug-in follow the typical phases of a Maven life cycle.

To deploy and run an EAR application on an Open Liberty server, you need to provide a server configuration file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the server configuration file.#
`ear/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/ear/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

You must configure the `server.xml` file with the [hotspot=EARdefinition file=1]`enterpriseApplication` element to specify the location of your EAR application.

// =================================================================================================
// Aggregating the entire build
// =================================================================================================

== Aggregating the entire build

Because you have multiple modules, aggregate the Maven projects to simplify the build process.

Create a parent [hotspot]`pom.xml` file under the `start` directory to link all of the child modules together. A template is provided for you.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the start/POM file.#
`pom.xml`
----
start/pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----
Set the [hotspot=packaging file=0]`basic configuration` for the project. Set `pom` as the [hotspot=packagingType file=0]`packaging` element of the parent [hotspot]`pom.xml` file.

In the parent [hotspot]`pom.xml` file, list all of the [hotspot=modules file=0]`modules` that you want to aggregate for the application.


// =================================================================================================
// Building the modules
// =================================================================================================

== Building the modules

By aggregating the build in the previous section, you can run `mvn install` once from the `start` directory and it will automatically build all your modules. This command creates a JAR file in the `jar/target` directory, a WAR file in the `war/target` directory, and an EAR file in the `ear/target` directory, which contains the JAR and WAR files.

Use the following command to build the entire application from the `start` directory:

[role=command]
----
mvn install
----

Since the modules are independent, you can re-build them individually by running `mvn install` from the corresponding module directory.

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the application
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To deploy your EAR application on an Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:run` goal from the `ear` directory:

[role=command]
----
cd ear
mvn liberty:run
----

Once the server is running, you can find the application at the following URL: http://localhost:9080/converter/[http://localhost:9080/converter/^]

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `start\ear` directory in another command-line session:

[role=command]
----
mvn liberty:stop
----


// =================================================================================================
// Testing the multi-module application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the multi-module application

To test the multi-module application, add integration tests to the EAR project.

Navigate to the `start\ear` directory.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the integration test class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/IT.java`
----
IT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/ear/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/IT.java[]
----

The [hotspot=testIndexPage file=0]`testIndexPage` tests to check that you can access the landing page.

The [hotspot=testHeightsPage file=0]`testHeightsPage` tests to check that the application can process the input value and calculate the result correctly.

For a Maven EAR project, the [hotspot=testCompile file=1]`testCompile` goal is
specified for the [hotspot=maven-compiler-plugin file=1]`maven-compiler-plugin`
plug-in in your [hotspot file=1]`ear/pom.xml` file so that the test cases are
compiled and picked up for execution. Run the following command to compile the
test class:

[role=command]
----
mvn test-compile
----

ear/pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/ear/pom.xml[]
----

Then, enter the following command to start the server, run the tests, then stop the server:

[role=command]
----
mvn liberty:start failsafe:integration-test liberty:stop
----

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
